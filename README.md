# Cinema E-Booking System

### Project Description

The Cinema E-Booking System is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse movies, view showtimes, and securely book tickets online. The system is built with ReactJS, NextJS, and Tailwind CSS for an interactive and responsive frontend, while the backend is powered by Spring Boot and MySQL to manage users, bookings, and movie data efficiently. The project focuses on creating a smooth user experience for both regular users and administrators. It demonstrates strong implementation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, relational database design, and API integration between the frontend and backend systems.

Key objectives of the project include:
- Providing an intuitive interface for users to browse and reserve movie tickets.
- Designing a scalable backend that ensures high performance and secure data handling.
- Structuring a maintainable system that separates concerns across frontend, backend, and database layers.

- Handles routing, form validation, and asynchronous communication with backend APIs.

**Backend Layer**
- Developed using Spring Boot with Spring Web and Spring Data JPA.
- Implements the MVC design pattern for maintainability and scalability.
- Provides RESTful endpoints for movies, bookings, and user operations.
- Ensures secure data processing and validation for all booking transactions.
